    <h1>Higher Order Function</h1>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens. Functions can be
      treated values and pass into another function, assigned to a variable or
      even return from another function.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function that takes in another function as an argument or returns a
      function is known as a higher order function.
