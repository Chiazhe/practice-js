    <h1>Currying</h1>
    <h1>Definition:</h1>
    <p>
      Currying is a technique of breaking down a function that takes in multiple
      arguments into sequence of functions which each function take a single
      argument.
    </p>
    <h1>Example:</h1>
    <p>
      someFunction(1,2,3) can be called as someFunction(1)(2)(3) where we pass
      in arguments one by one.
    </p>
    <h1>Benefits:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Currying helps to avoid passing same variable again and again.</li>
      <li>
        It helps divide function into smaller function and handle it's own
        responsiblity.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's used in functional programming to create a higher-order function.
      </li>
    </ul>
